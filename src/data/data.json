This sure beats sitting at the Tax Collector's office for hours.  Highly recommend this business. Support your local business owner!  Note that they are located a little lower in the plaza, do not get confused with the Riverview title agency which is a real estate related business at the front.  Will recommend Riverview Auto Tag to all my friends and family!",
